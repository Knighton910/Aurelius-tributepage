        <p>Born in Spain, Ucubi a small town near Cordoba. Marcus' great grandfather Marcus Annius Verus rose the family to prominence with him being a senator</p>
        <br>
      
        <p>I learned modesty and manliness from memories from my father, but my father died when i was 3 yeards old. Raised by Grandfather, my mom following aristocratic customs, so i was in the care of nurses. Even so i credit my mom with teaching me "religous peity, simplicity in diet" and avoiding the ways of the rich. I lived in Caelian Hill, which i adore naming it "my Caelian"</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>Living in an upscale neiborhood, my grandfather taugh me "good character and avoidance of bad temper"  I was home schooled, avoided public schools thanks to Catilius Severus. I was taught the philisopical way by Diognetus a painting-master as well i enjoyed sleeping on the floor, until my mom convinced me to sleep on bed </p>
